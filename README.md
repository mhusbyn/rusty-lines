# rusty-lines

A Rust tool for counting lines of code. Inspired by
this [code kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata13-counting-code-lines/).

## TODO

- [ ] Read in file and output number of lines
- [ ] Add CI pipeline
- [ ] Validate file extension
- [ ] Ignore whitespace
- [ ] Ignore comments
- [ ] Traverse directory
- [ ] Make it configurable (input what constitutes comment, block comment, etc)
- [ ] Create threads for directory traversal
